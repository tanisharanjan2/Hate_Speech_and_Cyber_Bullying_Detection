# ðŸ›¡ AI-Powered Hate Speech & Cyberbullying Detection

This project is a full-stack machine learning application that detects hate speech and cyberbullying in user-inputted text. It uses NLP techniques for text classification and provides predictions via a RESTful API, with a React-based frontend interface.

---

##  Features

- Binary & multi-class text classification (e.g., hate speech, offensive language, neutral).
- TF-IDF-based machine learning model with Flask API.
- Interactive React frontend to test input messages in real time.
- CORS-enabled API for smooth frontend-backend integration.
- Model confidence score returned with each prediction.
- Error handling for network/API failures.

---

##  Tech Stack

###  Machine Learning
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression / SVM)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLTK for text preprocessing

###  Backend
- Python
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- Joblib (for saving and loading the model)

###  Frontend
- React.js
- Axios for API calls

## Dataset

We used a cleaned dataset derived from publicly available hate speech datasets. The dataset contains labeled tweets/comments with the following structure:

| text                  | hate_speech | offensive_language | neither |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| "I hate you so much"  | 1           | 0                   | 0       |
| "You're dumb"         | 0           | 1                   | 0       |
| "Nice work!"          | 0           | 0                   | 1       |

> Additional preprocessing included removing stopwords, lemmatization, and lowercasing all text.
